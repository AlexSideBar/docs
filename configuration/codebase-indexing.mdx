When you open a project in Alex Sidebar, it automatically analyzes and indexes your code files to better understand your codebase.

Think of this like creating a smart map of your code - Alex reads through each file and then can utilize this information to provide more accurate and relevant suggestions when going through your queries.

### What is Indexing?
Indexing is the process where Alex:
- Scans through all your code files
- Creates special embeddings for each file
- Stores these embeddings to quickly reference later

### Why is it Important?
This indexing helps Alex:
- Give you more accurate code suggestions
- Better understand the context when you ask questions
- Find relevant code examples from your own project
- Make smarter recommendations based on your actual codebase

## Code Maps

Building on top of basic indexing, Alex now automatically parses your Swift project and constructs a "Code Map" for the files you are chatting about. This means Alex has an understanding of how files interact with each other, resulting in better code generation.

When you start a chat, Alex:
- Analyzes file dependencies and imports
- Maps class and type relationships
- Understands protocol conformances
- Tracks function calls between files

This deeper understanding helps Alex:
- Generate more accurate code suggestions
- Provide better refactoring recommendations
- Maintain consistency across related files
- Respect your project's architecture

<Note>
  Code Maps are enabled by default for all chats, so you don't need to do anything extra to get these benefits!

## Managing Indexes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Index Management">
    Open the "Indexed Files" section in Settings to access the indexing UI.
    
    Here you can:
    - View all indexed files
    - Check indexing status
    - Manage existing indexes
    - Set custom override paths
  </Step>

  <Step title="Index Operations">
    The following operations are available:
    - **Reload Index**: Initialize or refresh indexing for files
    - **Delete Index**: Remove existing index data
    - **Set override path**: Manually specify a folder path to index
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Automatic Synchronization
Your codebase index automatically updates when:
- Files are modified
- New files are added
- Files are deleted
- Git branches are switched

This ensures Alex Sidebar always has the most up-to-date information about your codebase!
