## Window Activation

### Auto-activate on Hover

When enabled, Alex Sidebar automatically becomes active when you move your mouse cursor over its window. This provides quick access without requiring clicks, ideal for reference-heavy development sessions.

<Note>
  This setting is particularly useful when you frequently switch between Xcode
  and Alex Sidebar during development.
</Note>

### Auto-activate with Xcode

Automatically brings Alex Sidebar to focus whenever Xcode becomes the active application. This ensures your AI assistant is always ready when you switch back to coding.

## Window Positioning

### Auto-position Next to Xcode

When enabled, Alex Sidebar automatically positions itself adjacent to your Xcode window. This creates an efficient side-by-side workflow where:

- The sidebar docks to the most right edge of Xcode
- Window positioning updates when Xcode moves

<Tip>
  This feature works best with "Match height with Xcode" enabled for a perfectly
  aligned development environment.
