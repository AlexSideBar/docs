The Image-to-Code feature allows you to quickly convert design mockups, screenshots, or UI elements into code. Simply drag and drop any image into Alex Sidebar to generate corresponding code.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Your Image">
    Supported formats: - PNG - JPEG - Screenshots directly from Xcode/Figma For
    best results, ensure your image clearly shows the UI elements you want to
    convert.
  </Step>

<Step title="Drag and Drop">
  Drag your image directly into the chat interface. You can: - Drag from Finder
  - Drag from browser - Drag from design tools - Paste from clipboard
</Step>

  <Step title="Review Generated Code">
    Alex will analyze the image and generate corresponding code. You
    can: - Copy the code directly - Request modifications - Ask for explanations
    of specific parts
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Image Preparation

- Use high-resolution images for better accuracy
- Crop to include only relevant UI elements
- Ensure good contrast between elements
- Include any specific styling details you want to capture

### Code Generation

- Start with simple components before complex layouts
- Review generated code for customization needs
- Use follow-up questions to refine the output
- Consider breaking complex UIs into smaller pieces

<Tip>
  For complex designs, try generating code for individual components first, then
  combine them into the final layout.
</Tip>

## Example Workflows

### Basic UI Component

<Steps>
  <Step title="Capture Component">
    Take a screenshot of a button or card design
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate Code">
    Drag the image into Alex Sidebar
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customize">    
  ```swift
    // Generated code example
    struct CustomButton: View {
      var body: some View {
        Button(action: {}) {
          Text("Get Started")
            .font(.headline)
            .foregroundColor(.white)
            .padding(.horizontal, 24)
            .padding(.vertical, 12)
            .background(Color.blue)
            .cornerRadius(8)
        }
      }
    }    
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Complex Layout

<Steps>
  <Step title="Break Down Design">Identify main components in your layout</Step>

<Step title="Generate Components">Generate code for each major section</Step>

  <Step title="Combine">
    Ask Alex to help combine components into a cohesive layout
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Inaccurate Component Detection">
    - Ensure image quality is high - Try cropping closer to the component - Use
    screenshots rather than photos - Provide additional context in your prompt
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Style Matching Issues">
  - Specify exact colors if known - Include style guide references - Ask for
  specific modifications - Use follow-up questions for refinement
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Layout Problems">
    - Break complex layouts into sections - Specify constraints explicitly - Ask
    for alternative layout approaches - Provide reference screenshots
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limitations

<Warning>
  Current limitations of the Image-to-Code feature: - Complex gradients may need
  manual adjustment - Custom animations require additional specification -
  Platform-specific components may need modification - Some advanced SwiftUI
  features may need manual implementation
</Warning>

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic components before attempting complex layouts
2. **Iterate**: Use follow-up questions to refine the generated code
3. **Combine Methods**: Use both image and text descriptions for better results
4. **Review Output**: Always review and test generated code in your project

<Note>
  Remember that Image-to-Code is a starting point. You can always ask Alex to
  modify the generated code to better match your needs.
