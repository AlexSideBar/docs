## Overview

Think Mode allows you to see the AI's reasoning process as it formulates responses. When enabled, the model does step-by-step reasoning, building logical chains to approach problems. This is helpful for complex problem-solving, debugging, and learning.

## Supported Models

Think Mode is available for:
- **Claude Sonnet 4** (optional think mode)
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (optional think mode)
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (mandatory think mode)
- **DeepSeek R1** (mandatory think mode)
- **OpenAI o4 Mini** (optional think mode with high thinking budget)

## How to Use

### Toggle Think Mode

<Keyboard shortcut="âŒ˜T" />

**Two ways to enable Think Mode:**

1. **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press **Command + T** to toggle Think Mode on or off during any conversation
2. **UI Button**: Use the **Think** button under each message input for individual messages

### Visual Indicators

When Think Mode is enabled:
- A dedicated thinking section appears in the chat
- Thinking blocks are separated into their own section (except OpenAI o4 Mini)
- The AI's reasoning process is displayed before the final response
- You can see how the AI breaks down problems and considers different approaches

**Note**: Some models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek R1) have mandatory think mode, while others (Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Flash, o4 Mini) allow you to toggle it on/off.

## When to Use Think Mode

### Recommended For:
- **Complex Problem Solving**: Multi-step problems requiring deep analysis
- **Hard Bugs**: Difficult debugging scenarios that need systematic investigation
- **Architecture Decisions**: System design and complex refactoring choices
- **Learning**: Understanding the reasoning behind AI suggestions
- **Code Reviews**: Evaluating code quality with detailed analysis
- **Business Logic**: Complex workflows requiring careful consideration

### Not Necessary For:
- Simple code completions
- Quick syntax questions
- Straightforward refactoring tasks
- High-volume, repetitive tasks
- When you need fast responses without detailed reasoning
- Everyday coding tasks

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with Complex Tasks">
    Enable Think Mode for problems involving multiple reasoning steps or complex business logic
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Toggle for Efficiency">
    Switch between modes based on task complexity - use normal mode for everyday tasks and Think Mode for challenging problems
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Learn from the Process">
    Review the thinking process to understand problem-solving approaches and improve your own reasoning
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Performance Considerations

<Warning>
  Think Mode may increase response time as the AI performs deeper analysis. The trade-off is more accurate and well-reasoned solutions for complex problems.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  For the best balance:
  - Use normal mode for quick edits and simple tasks
  - Enable Think Mode with **Command + T** only when you need deep reasoning
  - The longer the model thinks, the better the results for complex problems
