title: "Thinking Mode"
description: "Toggle AI thinking process visibility for better insight into responses"
---

## Overview

Thinking Mode allows you to see the AI's reasoning process in real-time as it formulates responses. This feature provides transparency into how the AI arrives at its solutions and can be particularly helpful for complex problem-solving.

## Supported Models

Thinking Mode is available for:
- **Claude Sonnet 4**
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (displays thinking blocks separately)

<Note>
  Claude Sonnet 4 may not stream thinking tokens in real-time due to backend limitations, but the thinking process is still happening even if not immediately visible.
</Note>

## How to Use

### Toggle Thinking Mode

<Keyboard shortcut="âŒ˜T" />

Press **Command + T** to toggle Thinking Mode on or off during any conversation.

### Visual Indicators

When Thinking Mode is enabled:
- A dedicated thinking section appears in the chat
- For Gemini 2.5 Pro, thinking blocks are separated into their own section
- The AI's reasoning process is displayed before the final response
- You can see how the AI breaks down problems and considers different approaches

## Benefits

## When to Use Thinking Mode

### Recommended For:
- **Complex Problem Solving**: When tackling difficult bugs or architectural decisions
- **Learning**: When you want to understand the reasoning behind suggestions
- **Code Reviews**: To see how the AI evaluates code quality and improvements
- **Debugging AI Responses**: If you receive unexpected suggestions

### Not Necessary For:
- Simple code completions
- Quick syntax questions
- Straightforward refactoring tasks
- When you need fast responses without detailed reasoning

## Example Use Case

```swift
// When asking about optimizing a complex algorithm
// Enable Thinking Mode with Cmd+T to see:
// 1. How the AI analyzes the current implementation
// 2. What performance considerations it evaluates
// 3. Why it suggests specific optimizations
// 4. Trade-offs between different approaches
```

## Tips

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable for Complex Tasks">
    Turn on Thinking Mode when dealing with architectural decisions or complex debugging scenarios
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Toggle as Needed">
    You can enable or disable Thinking Mode at any point in the conversation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review the Process">
    Take time to read through the thinking process to understand the AI's approach
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Thinking Mode may slightly increase response time as the full reasoning process is displayed. Toggle it off with **Command + T** when you need faster responses.
