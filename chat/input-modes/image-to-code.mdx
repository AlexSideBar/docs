The Image-to-Code feature allows you to quickly convert design mockups, screenshots, or UI elements into code. Simply drag and drop one or multiple images into Alex Sidebar to generate corresponding code.

## Getting Started
<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Your Images">
    Supported formats:
    - PNG
    - JPEG 
    - Screenshots directly from Xcode/Figma
    
    For best results, ensure your images clearly show the UI elements you want to convert.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Drag and Drop">
    Drag your images directly into the chat interface. You can:
    - Drag single or multiple images at once
    - Drag from Finder
    - Drag from browser
    - Drag from design tools
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Generated Code">
    The eligible model will analyze the images and generate corresponding code. You can:
    - Copy the code directly
    - Request modifications
    - Ask for explanations of specific parts
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Image Preparation

- Use high-resolution images for better accuracy
- Crop to include only relevant UI elements
- Ensure good contrast between elements
- Include any specific styling details as prompt you want to capture

### Code Generation

- Start with simple components before complex layouts
- Review generated code for customization needs
- Use follow-up questions to refine the output
- Consider breaking complex UIs into smaller pieces

<Tip>
  For complex designs, try generating code for individual components first, then
  combine them into the final layout.
</Tip>

## Example Workflows

### Basic UI Component

<Steps>
  <Step title="Capture Component">
    Take a screenshot of a button or card design
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate Code">
    Drag the image into Alex Sidebar
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customize">    
  ```swift
    // Generated code example
    struct CustomButton: View {
      var body: some View {
        Button(action: {}) {
          Text("Get Started")
            .font(.headline)
            .foregroundColor(.white)
            .padding(.horizontal, 24)
            .padding(.vertical, 12)
            .background(Color.blue)
            .cornerRadius(8)
        }
      }
    }    
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Complex Layout

<Steps>
  <Step title="Break Down Design">
    Identify main components in your layout. You can:
    - Split your design into logical sections
    - Take screenshots of individual components
    - Prepare multiple images for different parts
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Components">
    You have two options:
    - Drag multiple component images at once to generate all parts simultaneously
    - Generate code for each major section individually
  </Step>

  <Step title="Combine">
    Ask Alex to help combine components into a cohesive layout. You can:
    - Request adjustments to match the overall design
    - Fine-tune spacing and alignment
    - Add container views and navigation elements
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Inaccurate Component Detection">
    - Ensure image quality is high
    - Try cropping closer to the component
    - Use screenshots rather than photos
    - Provide additional context in your prompt
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Style Matching Issues">
    - Specify exact colors if known
    - Include style guide references
    - Ask for specific modifications
    - Use follow-up questions for refinement
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Layout Problems">
    - Break complex layouts into sections
    - Specify constraints explicitly
    - Ask for alternative layout approaches
    - Provide reference screenshots
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic components before attempting complex layouts
2. **Iterate**: Use follow-up questions to refine the generated code
3. **Combine Methods**: Use both image and text descriptions for better results
4. **Review Output**: Always review and test generated code in your project

<Note>
  Remember that Image-to-Code is a starting point. You can always ask Alex to
  modify the generated code to better match your needs.
