## Accessibility Benefits

Voice Mode makes Alex more accessible and easier to use for everyone.

- When you are coding for long periods, **Voice Mode** lets you take breaks from typing while staying productive.

- For developers with mobility challenges or strain injuries, voice input provides a comfortable way to interact with Alex. You can dictate code explanations and questions instead.

- Having voice as an additional input option means you can choose what works best for you in different situations. Sometimes speaking is just more convenient than typing.

And when you need to explain complex concepts or walk through detailed logic, speaking it out loud often feels more natural and fluid than typing it all out.
