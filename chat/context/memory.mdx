- References past solutions when relevant
- Adapts responses based on historical context

## Managing Memory

### Enabling and Disabling

You can control memory settings through the Settings panel:

1. Open the Settings panel
2. Navigate to Memory preferences
3. Toggle the memory switch on/off

### Memory Search

  - Code snippets
  - Solutions
  - Topics

### Memory Cleanup

Keep your memory system optimized by:

- Removing individual conversation records
- Clearing topic-specific memories
- Performing bulk memory cleanup
- Setting automatic cleanup intervals

## Privacy and Security

### Data Storage

All memory data is:

## Best Practices

### Optimal Usage

For best results:

1. Enable memory for:
  - Long-term projects
  - Complex coding tasks
  - Learning sessions

2. Disable memory when:
  - Switching between projects
  - Working on sensitive code
  - Performing quick, one-off tasks

### Memory Management

Regular maintenance helps optimize performance:
