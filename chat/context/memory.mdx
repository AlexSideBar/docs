Memory or project notes enables Alex to maintain context across conversations for better and more contextually relevant interactions. This documentation explains how memory works and how to manage it well.

## Understanding Memory

### Purpose

Memory allows Alex to:
- Maintain context from previous conversations
- Provide more relevant and personalized responses
- Learn from your coding patterns and preferences
- Improve response accuracy over time

### How It Works

The memory system:
- Stores key information from your conversations
- Analyzes patterns in your coding style
- References past solutions when relevant
- Adapts responses based on historical context

## Managing Memory

### Enabling and Disabling

You can control memory settings through the Settings panel:

1. Open the Settings panel
2. Navigate to Memory preferences
3. Toggle the memory switch on/off

## Privacy and Security

### Data Storage

All memory data is:
- Stored locally on your device
- Never shared with external services

## Best Practices

For best results, enable memory for:
  - Long-term projects
  - Complex coding tasks
  - Learning sessions

### Memory Management

Regular maintenance helps optimize performance:

1. Review memories periodically
2. Remove outdated information
