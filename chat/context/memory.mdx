description: "Remember context across conversations with Alex"
---

Project Memory enables Alex to remember context across conversations by using terms like "remember this" or "keep this in mind". This helps maintain continuity and provides more contextually relevant responses over time.

## Understanding Project Memory

When enabled, you can ask Alex to remember context across conversations by using phrases like:
- "Remember this"
- "Keep this in mind"
- "Remember that..."
- "Take note of..."

This allows Alex to:
- Maintain important context between chat sessions
- Remember project-specific requirements and patterns
- Provide more consistent and personalized responses
- Reference previously discussed solutions

## Managing Project Memory

### Accessing Memory Settings

To manage your project memory:

1. Open Settings (gear icon)
2. Navigate to **Tools & Features** â†’ **Project Memory**
3. Toggle **Enable Memory** on/off using the switch

### Searching Memories

Once memories are saved, you can:
- Use the search bar to find specific memories
- View all stored memories in the list
- Delete individual memories as needed

### Creating Memories

Simply tell Alex what to remember during any conversation:
- "Remember that our app uses SwiftUI and MVVM architecture"
- "Keep in mind that we're targeting iOS 17+"
- "Note that all API calls should use async/await"

## Privacy and Security

All project memory data is:
- Stored locally on your device
- Never shared with external services
- Fully under your control

## Best Practices

### What to Remember

Use project memory for:
- **Project architecture**: "Remember we're using MVVM with Combine"
- **Coding standards**: "Keep in mind we use 2-space indentation"
- **API details**: "Remember our API base URL is api.example.com"
- **Team preferences**: "Note that we prefer guard statements over if-let"
- **Dependencies**: "Remember we're using Firebase for authentication"

### Memory Management Tips

1. **Be specific**: Clear, specific memories are more useful than vague ones
2. **Update regularly**: Remove outdated memories to keep context relevant
3. **Use search**: Quickly find memories using the search feature
4. **Review periodically**: Check your stored memories to ensure they're still accurate

<Note>
Project Memory is especially useful for long-term projects where maintaining consistent context across multiple coding sessions is important.
