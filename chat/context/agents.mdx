Alex Sidebar's agents are specialized AI assistants, each trained for specific development tasks. Alex automatically selects the right agent for your workflow for autonomously handling your development tasks!

<Note>
Agent mode is now always on! Claude 3.5 Sonnet remains the default model for its superior code generation capabilities, but you can now use other supported models including:
- DeepSeek R1
- DeepSeek V3
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- o3-mini
- GPT-4o
- o1
- Gemini 2.0 Flash

Choose your preferred model from the model selector while maintaining all agent capabilities.

## Understanding Agents

Agents work best by:
- Learning your project structure and patterns
- Maintaining contextual understanding across sessions
- Automating common development tasks
- Suggesting improvements based on best practices
- Using regex code search for precise file analysis

<Note>
  You can make agents more effective over time by providing more notes about your project and coding preferences. Learn more about project notes [here](/chat/context/memory).
</Note>

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize Agent">
    Press **Command + Shift + A** or use the **Agent Settings** dropdown to toggle **Use agent** for your project.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Project Introduction">
    Use voice or text to describe your project:
    ```swift
    "This is an iOS app using SwiftUI and MVVM architecture. 
    The main features include user authentication and data persistence."
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Let Agent Learn">
    The agent will:
    - Analyze project structure
    - Study coding patterns
    - Build contextual understanding
    - Use regex search to find relevant code patterns
  </Step>
</Steps>
