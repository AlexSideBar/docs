Alex Sidebar's AI Agents are specialized assistants, each trained for specific development tasks. The system automatically selects the right AI Agent for your workflow to autonomously handle your development tasks!

<Note>
Claude 3.5 Sonnet is used by default in Agent Mode because it is the best model for code generation. You can switch to a different AI model by disabling Agent Mode in the Agent Settings dropdown.

## Understanding AI Agents

AI Agents work best by:
- Learning your project structure and patterns
- Maintaining contextual understanding across sessions
- Automating common development tasks
- Suggesting improvements based on best practices
- Using regex code search for precise file analysis

<Note>
  You can make AI Agents more effective over time by providing more notes about your project and coding preferences. Learn more about project notes [here](/chat/context/memory).
