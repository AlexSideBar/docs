## Understanding Agents

Agents work best by:
- Learning your project structure and patterns
- Maintaining contextual understanding across sessions
- Automating common development tasks
- Suggesting improvements based on best practices

<Note>
  You can make agents more effective over time by providing more notes about your project and coding preferences. Learn more about project notes [here](/context/memory).
