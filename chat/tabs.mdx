## Overview

Chat Tabs allow you to maintain multiple concurrent chat sessions, making it easier to work on different tasks or contexts simultaneously. Each tab represents an independent chat session with its own context and history.

## Key Features

### Managing Tabs

- Create a new tab: `CMD+T`
- Close current tab: `CMD+W`
- Navigate between tabs: `Ctrl+Tab`

### Use Cases

- Maintain separate conversations for different parts of your codebase
- Work on multiple features simultaneously
- Keep reference documentation open in one tab while coding in another
- Isolate different debugging sessions

## Tips

- Each tab maintains its own context, so you can switch between different tasks without losing context
- Use tabs to organize your work by feature, component, or task type
- Close unused tabs to keep your workspace clean and focused
