![Alex Sidebar with Image Generation for creating app designs and logos.](/images/image-generation-demo.png)

## Overview

Alex now includes image generation capabilities, allowing you to create app designs, logos, and various visual assets directly within your chat. This feature helps streamline your development workflow by generating visual mockups and assets without leaving the IDE.

## How to Use

### Request Images

Simply ask Alex to generate any image you need:

- **App Designs**: "Can you make a couple of designs for my app for flight tracking?"
- **Logos**: "Can you generate different logos for the airlines?"
- **Icons**: "Create a set of icons for my weather app"
- **UI Mockups**: "Generate a dark mode design for my dashboard"

### Image Generation Process

1. **Request**: Describe what type of image you want
2. **Processing**: Alex creates detailed prompts for the image generation
3. **Generation**: Multiple images are generated based on your request
4. **Review**: Images appear directly in the chat for immediate use

## Examples

### App Design Generation

<CodeGroup>

```text User Request
"Can you make a couple of designs for my app for flight tracking, and then create the code?"
```

```text AI Response
I'll create a couple of flight tracking app designs for you and then implement one of them.

Creating image:
- A modern iOS flight tracking app interface with a clean design showing departure/arrival cities, flight status, gate info, and a search bar at the top. Light blue and white color scheme with airplane icons.
- A dark iOS flight tracking app design with flight cards showing airline logo, flight number, departure/arrival times, and real-time status updates. Modern glassmorphism effect with purple and blue gradients.
```

### Logo Generation

<CodeGroup>

```text User Request
"Can you generate different logos for the airlines so I can add them to assets?"
```

```text AI Response
I'll create airline logos for the flights in your app.

Creating image:
- American Airlines logo - modern minimalist design with red, white and blue colors, circular icon format suitable for iOS app
- United Airlines logo - clean blue and white design with stylized U symbol, circular icon format for mobile app
- Delta Airlines logo - red triangular delta symbol on blue background, circular icon format for iOS application

## Tips for Better Results

<Tip>
  **Color Schemes**: Specify exact colors or describe the mood (e.g., "modern purple and blue gradients", "minimalist black and white")
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Style References**: Mention specific design styles (e.g., "glassmorphism", "flat design", "material design")
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Platform-Specific**: Indicate the target platform (e.g., "iOS app", "Android Material Design", "web application")
</Tip>

## Integration with Code

After generating designs, Alex can:
1. Implement the UI based on the generated mockups
2. Extract color schemes and apply them to your code
3. Create responsive layouts matching the designs
4. Generate CSS/styling code from the visual concepts

<Note>
  Generated images can be saved directly to your project's assets folder for immediate use in development.
