  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Model Details">
    1. Enter the Model ID (e.g., `qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct`, `llama-3.3-70b-instruct`)
    2. Provide the Base URL for your model's API endpoint
    3. Add your API Key for authentication
    4. (Optional) Specify if the model supports image inputs
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Example: Qwen 2.5 32B Coder Model">
    To run the Qwen 2.5 32B Coder model:
    - Model ID: `qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct`
    - Base URL: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`
    - Enter your API Key in the provided field
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Finalize Setup">
