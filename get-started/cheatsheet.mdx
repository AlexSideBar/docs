<Note>
  These model recommendations are opinionated and based on general use cases. You should experiment with different models to find which ones work best for your specific needs and coding style. Each developer may have different preferences based on their workflow and the types of problems they are solving.

## Best Practices
1. **Code Context**
   - Select relevant code before starting chat
   - Include imports and related types
   - Provide clear and **specific** questions

2. **Model Selection**
   - Switch models if not getting desired results

## Common Use Cases & Workflows

### Code Review
1. Select code → ⌘ + L
2. Ask for review
3. Add context with ⌘ + ⇧ + L if needed
4. Use ▶️ to apply suggestions

### Quick Fixes
1. Place cursor where you want to fix
2. ⌘ + K for suggestions
3. Use **esc** to dismiss if needed

### Warnings and Errors
1. Click error/warning indicator in Xcode's editor near line number
2. Review AI-suggested fixes
3. Click ▶️ to implement changes, or use Quick Apply (⏩) for instant application
4. For complex cases:
   - Select problematic code and copy error/warning
   - Use ⌘ + L for detailed help
   - Add context as needed

Common fixes include:
- Build errors (imports, types)
- Deprecated API usage

## Configuration Tips
- Customize shortcuts in Settings
- Set up system and custom prompts for repeated tasks

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Do not provide too little context
- Do not stick with one model if struggling
