### 1. What models should I use?

[Blog in-progress, please hold tight]

### 2. I just subscribed to the Mini plan, but it's giving me an error.

The Mini plan is a "Bring your own key" plan. It's meant for people who'd like to control their own AI spend. This means, you get 0 chat messages per month, and would need to get an API key from either Anthropic, Gemini, or OpenAI, to continue using the chat models.

The Mini plan's benefit is that it has Unlimited Code Apply, letting your models apply changes to your files near-instantly.

+ Things like Unlimited Autocomplete.

### 3. Can I use Alex completely free?

Yes! You can use our chat functionalities with your own API keys. You just won't get access to the Code Apply feature.

### 4. Can I use codebase embeddings for free?

Yes! Our codebase embeddings model is provided for free to all users. You don't need to bring an API key for it.

### 5. Can I use Alex with local models?

Yes! You can add your local models (e.g. Ollama or LM Studio) in `Settings > Models & API Keys`.

Make sure you add the v1, for example: `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`

You don't need to put an API key, unless you've enabled it yourself.

### 6. Alex is not letting me login to a new device because I've reached my 2 device limit. What can I do?

Login to our portal: https://alexcodes.app/admin

Find the "Devices" section, and remove the serial number associated with the older device you no longer want on your account.

Just remember that there is always limit of 2 devices per account.

### 7. Our company has an AI proxy that isn't available publicly. How can I use it?

Our team plans allow you to override all our model endpoints.

To get started:

1. Go to your portal: https://alexcodes.app/admin
2. Click on "Create New Team" and give it a name
3. Go to the "Models" tab
4. Add any chat models you'd like to use.

> Note: The chat model needs to follow the OpenAI scheme.

You can also override the Autocomplete, Embeddings, Voice, Thinking, Web Search, and Code Apply models.

By doing this, you completely bypass our server.

### 8. How do I set my VAT ID?

1. Go to your billing portal (https://alexcodes.app/admin > Manage Subscription)
2. Scroll down to "Billing Information"
3. Click "Update Information"
4. Scroll down to "Tax ID", and set your VAT
5. Click Save

### 9. Can I disable Telemetry (Analytics + Crash Logs)?

Yes, but only on team accounts.

Once you create your team account on the portal (see above), click on the "Advanced" tab, and disable telemetry.

Your team users will all stop collecting telemetry. Make sure to login through Alex + restart the app to apply the changes.

### 10. Can I disable auto-compiling?

Yes. You can control what tools are provided to Alex by going to `Settings > Tools` and disabling the tools you don't want.

You can then manually click the "Build and Fix Errors" button in the chat view whenever you like.

### 11. How do I stop Alex from automatically changing my files?

Next to the model selector, there's a toggle that either shows "Manual" or "Auto Apply".

Make sure it shows "Manual", and Alex won't automatically apply changes.

### 12. I'm getting a "Rate limit Exceeded" error, or a "Maximum Tokens exceeded" error

If you have your own API key inserted, make sure that you have increased your rate-limits with Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini.

Sometimes the default rate limits are really low (e.g. 20k tokens / minute). This makes any chat unlikely to send.

You should check how to increase your rate limits with these services. Here are some helpful links:

- Anthropic: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits
- OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits
- Gemini: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits

You usually need to add a certain number of $ credits to your account to pass their rate limits.

> Note: This has nothing to do with Alex. If you don't want to worry about rate limits, subscribe to our Pro or Premium plans to use our "Chat Messages" credit system.

### 13. I would like to cancel my subscription. How can I do that?

Go to https://alexcodes.app/admin and click "Manage / Cancel Subscription".

### 14. I clicked "Start Free Trial" and it immediately upgraded me.

This is a known issue when you have previously had a trial of that product. We'll update it soon to prevent this.

### 15. Do you use our data for training?

We don't collect your chat requests for training unless you've opted into training mode during onboarding. If you'd like to disable it, go to `Settings > Privacy`.

We collect Crash Logs & Analytics (via Sentry and PostHog) which you cannot disable -- unless you are on a team plan (see #9.)
