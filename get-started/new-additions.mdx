Alex Sidebar now supports the features announced at WWDC 2025, including the Liquid Glass design system, new commands, and the latest APIs. This guide shows you how to use these new capabilities in your development workflow.

## WWDC 2025 Highlights

<Note>
  Apple has transitioned to year-based naming: iOS 26, macOS 26, and visionOS 26 replace the traditional version numbers. Alex Sidebar is fully updated to support all new APIs and design patterns.

## Commands in Alex Sidebar

Alex Sidebar has new commands to help you implement the latest Apple design and work with the latest APIs. Use these command tags to access specific capabilities:

### @WWDC25 Mode

Access the latest Apple technologies by prefixing your requests with `@WWDC25`:

```
@WWDC25 Implement the new SpeechAnalyzer API for real-time transcription
```

This mode gives Alex specialized knowledge of:
- All iOS 26, macOS 26, and visionOS 26 APIs
- Liquid Glass design implementation
- New SwiftUI features like Rich Text Editor and 3D Charts
- Performance optimizations and best practices

**Example Uses:**
```
@WWDC25 Create a 3D chart in the given view with the new Charts API
@WWDC25 Implement the new WebKit APIs for in-app browsers
```

### @Foundation Models Command

Use Apple's privacy-focused AI models directly in your apps:

```
@FoundationModel Create a suggestion system using the new Foundation Models API for generating name recommendations
```

**Capabilities:**
- On-device AI inference with no cost and offline functionality
- Guided generation for consistent, structured outputs
- Tool calling and function integration
- Privacy-focused processing that never leaves the device
- Native Swift support with async/await patterns

**Example Implementation:**
```swift
import FoundationModels

// Access Apple's on-device foundation model with just a few lines
let session = try await LanguageModelSession()

// Generate structured data from natural language
let prompt = "Create a daily journal entry from these notes: \(userNotes)"
let response = try await session.respond(
    to: prompt,
    generating: JournalEntry.self
)

// The model runs entirely on-device, protecting user privacy
let journalEntry = response.content
```

### @Liquid Glass Command

Update your UI with the new Liquid Glass design system:

```
@Liquid Glass Update the custom button to use the new Liquid Glass effect
```

**Features:**
- Use the new Liquid Glass API to create translucent, adaptive interfaces

## Combining Commands

Use multiple commands together for additional capabilities:

```
@WWDC25 @Liquid Glass @Foundation Models 
Create an AI-powered notes app with speech transcription and the new design system
```

This combination:
1. Uses SpeechAnalyzer for transcription (@WWDC25)
2. Applies Liquid Glass UI throughout (@Liquid Glass)
3. Uses Foundation Models for summarization (@Foundation Models)

## Migration Guide

### Updating Existing Apps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable WWDC25 Mode">
    Start your migration with:
    ```
    @WWDC25 Analyze my app for iOS 26 compatibility
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply Liquid Glass">
    Transform your UI incrementally:
    ```
    @Liquid Glass Update my main navigation with the new design
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate AI Features">
    Add intelligence thoughtfully:
    ```
    @Foundation Models Suggest AI improvements for my app
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Performance First">
    - Leverage the 6x faster list performance automatically
    - Use on-device Foundation Models when possible
    - Profile with the new SwiftUI Instruments template
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Design Consistency">
    - Adopt Liquid Glass gradually across your app
    - Ensure accessibility with reduced transparency options
    - Test on all platforms for consistent experience
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Privacy by Design">
    - Prefer on-device processing with Foundation Models
    - Implement proper consent for AI features
    - Use differential privacy for analytics
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick Reference

| Feature | Command | Example Usage |
