If you're using your own API keys with Alex Sidebar, you'll eventually hit rate limits. This guide helps you understand, diagnose, and fix rate limit issues for each provider.

## What You'll See When You Hit Rate Limits

### The Dreaded 429 Error

All providers return a `429` HTTP status code when you exceed rate limits, but the error messages differ:

**Anthropic (Claude)**
```
429 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"rate_limit_error","message":"Number of request tokens has exceeded your per-minute rate limit"}}
```

**OpenAI** 
```
Error: 429 - Rate limit exceeded: You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details
```

**Gemini**
```
Error 429: RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED - Quota exceeded for quota metric
```

## Understanding Rate Limits

Each provider measures limits differently:

### Anthropic
- **RPM**: Requests per minute
- **ITPM**: Input tokens per minute  
- **OTPM**: Output tokens per minute

### OpenAI
- **RPM**: Requests per minute
- **TPM**: Total tokens per minute (input + output)
- **RPD**: Requests per day (for some models)

### Gemini
- **RPM**: Requests per minute
- **TPD**: Tokens per day
- **RPD**: Requests per day

## Check Your Current Limits

### Anthropic Console
1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Click on "Usage" in the sidebar.
3. Check "Rate-limited requests" to see the number of requests that were blocked due to rate limits.

### OpenAI Platform  
1. Visit [platform.openai.com/account/limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/limits)
2. See your tier and current limits
3. Check usage at [platform.openai.com/usage](https://platform.openai.com/usage)

### Google Cloud Console
1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Click "Quotas & System Limits"

## How to Increase Your Limits

### Anthropic
- Spend more to automatically get higher limits
- Contact sales for enterprise needs

### OpenAI  
- Increase limits by spending (not just depositing) money
- Multiple tiers available with different requirements
- Check [platform.openai.com/account/limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/limits) for current tier info

### Gemini
- Request increases through Google Cloud Console
- Manual approval required

## Quick Fixes When You're Rate Limited

### 1. Switch Models Temporarily
Each model has separate limits. If Claude Sonnet is rate limited, try:
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (older version)
- Switch to OpenAI or Gemini
- Use Alex's built-in credits instead

### 2. Wait Before Retrying
If you hit a rate limit, wait a bit before trying again. The error message might tell you how long to wait.

### 3. Reduce Your Usage
- Ask for shorter responses
- Send fewer messages
- Use a model with higher limits

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### "I just created an account and I'm already rate limited!"

New accounts typically have very low default limits. You'll need to add credits or enable billing to get usable limits. Check each provider's documentation for current requirements.

### "I added money but limits didn't increase"

- Some providers require you to actually spend money, not just add it
- Limit increases aren't always instant
- Check your provider's console for current limits

### "Rate limits are killing my productivity"

Consider using Alex Sidebar's built-in credits. You won't have to worry about:
- Managing multiple API keys
- Tracking spending across providers  
- Dealing with rate limits
- Waiting for tier upgrades

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor usage proactively** - Don't wait for errors
2. **Set up billing alerts** - Know before you hit limits
3. **Use multiple API keys** - Rotate between them
4. **Implement caching** - Don't make the same request twice
5. **Log rate limit errors** - Track patterns and adjust

## Provider-Specific Tips

### Anthropic
- Workspaces let you set custom limits per project
- Prompt caching is free from rate limits (for cached portions)
- Different models have different limits - use this strategically

### OpenAI  
- o1 models have special limits even at higher tiers
- GPT-4 has lower limits than GPT-3.5
- Batch API has separate, higher limits

### Gemini
- Gemini 1.5 Pro has 3x higher limits than before (as of Sept 2024)
- Vertex AI quotas are separate from AI Studio quotas
- Location matters - some regions have higher limits

## Still Stuck?

If you're consistently hitting rate limits despite following this guide:

1. **Check your code** - You might be making more requests than you think
2. **Contact support** - Each provider has ways to request custom limits
3. **Consider Alex credits** - Our Pro and Unlimited plans eliminate these headaches

Rate limits exist to ensure fair usage and system stability. Understanding how they work helps you plan your development workflow better.
