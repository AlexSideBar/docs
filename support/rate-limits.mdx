If you're using your own API keys with Alex Sidebar, you'll eventually hit rate limits. This guide helps you understand, diagnose, and fix rate limit issues for each provider.

## What You'll See When You Hit Rate Limits

### The Dreaded 429 Error

All providers return a `429` HTTP status code when you exceed rate limits, but the error messages differ:

**Anthropic (Claude)**
```
429 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"rate_limit_error","message":"Number of request tokens has exceeded your per-minute rate limit"}}
```

**OpenAI** 
```
Error: 429 - Rate limit exceeded: You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details
```

**Gemini**
```
Error 429: RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED - Quota exceeded for quota metric
```

## Understanding Rate Limits

Each provider measures limits differently:

### Anthropic
- **RPM**: Requests per minute
- **ITPM**: Input tokens per minute  
- **OTPM**: Output tokens per minute

### OpenAI
- **RPM**: Requests per minute
- **TPM**: Total tokens per minute (input + output)
- **RPD**: Requests per day (for some models)

### Gemini
- **RPM**: Requests per minute
- **TPD**: Tokens per day
- **RPD**: Requests per day

## Check Your Current Limits

### Anthropic Console
1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Click on "Usage" in the sidebar.
3. Check "Rate-limited requests" to see the number of requests that were blocked due to rate limits.

### OpenAI Platform  
1. Visit [platform.openai.com/account/limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/limits)
2. See your tier and current limits
3. Check usage at [platform.openai.com/usage](https://platform.openai.com/usage)

### Google Cloud Console
1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Click "Quotas & System Limits"

## How to Increase Your Limits

### Anthropic: Progress Through Usage Tiers

Anthropic uses automatic tier progression based on spending:

1. **Add credits to your account** - The more you spend, the higher your tier
2. **Contact sales** for enterprise limits via the Console
3. **Use prompt caching** - Cached tokens don't count against ITPM for Claude 3.5 Sonnet
4. **Set workspace limits** - Prevent one project from using all your quota

<Note>
Anthropic measures limits separately per model. You can use different models up to their respective limits simultaneously.
</Note>

### OpenAI: Climb the Tiers

OpenAI has 6 usage tiers with specific requirements:

| Tier | Requirement | Time Wait |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Free | Default | - |
| Tier 1 | $5 paid | Immediate |
| Tier 2 | $50 paid | 7+ days |
| Tier 3 | $250 paid | 7+ days |
| Tier 4 | $500 paid | 14+ days |
| Tier 5 | $1,000 paid | 30+ days |

**Important**: The requirement is based on amount spent, not just deposited. Tier upgrades can take up to 7 days to process.

For higher limits, apply for Scale Tier at [openai.com/api-scale-tier](https://openai.com/api-scale-tier).

### Gemini: Request Increases

Gemini allows manual quota increases:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Navigate to "IAM & Admin" → "Quotas"
3. Search for `aiplatform.googleapis.com/generate_content_requests`
4. Click the three dots → "Edit quota"
5. Enter new limit and submit request

For Firebase users:
1. Go to Firebase Console → AI Logic API
2. Click "Manage" → "Quotas & System Limits"  
3. Select "Edit quota" and submit request

## Quick Fixes When You're Rate Limited

### 1. Switch Models Temporarily
Each model has separate limits. If Claude Sonnet is rate limited, try:
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (older version)
- Switch to OpenAI or Gemini
- Use Alex's built-in credits instead

### 2. Implement Smart Retries
```python
# Don't do this:
while error == 429:
    retry()  # Bad! Burns through your limit

# Do this instead:
wait_time = 1
while error == 429:
    sleep(wait_time)
    wait_time *= 2  # Exponential backoff
    retry()
```

### 3. Optimize Your Requests
- Reduce `max_tokens` to match expected output
- Batch similar requests together
- Cache responses to avoid duplicate calls
- Use streaming for long responses

### 4. Check the Headers
Most APIs return helpful headers:
```
retry-after: 30  # Wait 30 seconds
x-ratelimit-remaining: 10  # 10 requests left
x-ratelimit-reset: 1701234567  # Unix timestamp when limit resets
```

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### "I just created an account and I'm already rate limited!"

**OpenAI**: New accounts start with very low limits (sometimes 3 RPM). Add $5 to reach Tier 1 immediately.

**Anthropic**: Default limits are minimal. Add $10-20 to get started properly.

**Gemini**: Free tier is 60 RPM. Enable billing for higher limits.

### "I added money but limits didn't increase"

**OpenAI**: Remember it's based on SPEND, not balance. Also, tier upgrades take up to 7 days.

**Anthropic**: Check your console for updated limits after adding credits.

**Gemini**: Manual quota increases require approval.

### "Rate limits are killing my productivity"

Consider using Alex Sidebar's built-in credits. You won't have to worry about:
- Managing multiple API keys
- Tracking spending across providers  
- Dealing with rate limits
- Waiting for tier upgrades

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor usage proactively** - Don't wait for errors
2. **Set up billing alerts** - Know before you hit limits
3. **Use multiple API keys** - Rotate between them
4. **Implement caching** - Don't make the same request twice
5. **Log rate limit errors** - Track patterns and adjust

## Provider-Specific Tips

### Anthropic
- Workspaces let you set custom limits per project
- Prompt caching is free from rate limits (for cached portions)
- Different models have different limits - use this strategically

### OpenAI  
- o1 models have special limits even at higher tiers
- GPT-4 has lower limits than GPT-3.5
- Batch API has separate, higher limits

### Gemini
- Gemini 1.5 Pro has 3x higher limits than before (as of Sept 2024)
- Vertex AI quotas are separate from AI Studio quotas
- Location matters - some regions have higher limits

## Still Stuck?

If you're consistently hitting rate limits despite following this guide:

1. **Check your code** - You might be making more requests than you think
2. **Contact support** - Each provider has ways to request custom limits
3. **Consider Alex credits** - Our Pro and Unlimited plans eliminate these headaches

Rate limits exist to ensure fair usage and system stability. Understanding how they work helps you plan your development workflow better.
