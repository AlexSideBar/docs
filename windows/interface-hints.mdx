Get the most out of Alex Sidebar's window management features with these tips and recommendations.

## Quick Setup Guide

For the best experience, we recommend enabling all window settings:

1. **Bring Alex to front when Xcode is clicked** - Keeps Alex accessible
2. **Auto-Snap Alex next to Xcode** - Perfect side-by-side layout
3. **Let Alex fill rest of the screen** - Maximum workspace efficiency
4. **Match height with Xcode** - Clean, aligned interface
5. **Stay on top** - Always visible when needed
