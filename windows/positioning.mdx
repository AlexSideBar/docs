## Auto-position Next to Xcode

When enabled, Alex Sidebar automatically positions itself adjacent to your Xcode window. This creates an efficient side-by-side workflow where:

- The sidebar docks to the most right edge of Xcode
- Window positioning updates when Xcode moves

<Tip>
  This feature works best with "Match height with Xcode" enabled for a perfectly
  aligned development environment.
