## Commands in Alex Sidebar

Alex Sidebar has new commands to help you implement the latest design and work with the latest APIs. Use these command tags to access specific capabilities:

### @WWDC25 Mode

Access the latest Apple technologies by prefixing your requests with `@WWDC25`:

```
@WWDC25 Implement the new SpeechAnalyzer API for real-time transcription
```

This mode gives Alex the context of:
- All iOS 26, macOS 26, and visionOS 26 APIs
- Liquid Glass design implementation
- New SwiftUI features like Rich Text Editor and 3D Charts
- Performance optimizations and best practices

**Example Uses:**
```
@WWDC25 Create a 3D chart in the given view with the new Charts API
@WWDC25 Implement the new WebKit APIs for in-app browsers
```

### @Foundation Models Command

Use Apple's privacy-focused AI models directly in your apps:

```
@FoundationModel Create a suggestion system using the new Foundation Models API for generating name recommendations
```

**Capabilities:**
- On-device AI inference with no cost and offline functionality
- Guided generation for consistent, structured outputs
- Tool calling and function integration
- Privacy-focused processing that never leaves the device
- Native Swift support with async/await patterns

**Example Implementation:**
```swift
import FoundationModels

// Access Apple's on-device foundation model with just a few lines
let session = try await LanguageModelSession()

// Generate structured data from natural language
let prompt = "Create a daily journal entry from these notes: \(userNotes)"

let response = try await session.respond(
    to: prompt,
    generating: JournalEntry.self
)

// The model runs entirely on-device, protecting user privacy
let journalEntry = response.content
```

### @Liquid Glass Command

Update your UI with the new Liquid Glass design system:

```
@Liquid Glass Update the custom button to use the new Liquid Glass design
```

## Combining Commands

Use multiple commands together for better results:

```
@WWDC25 @Liquid Glass @Foundation Models 
Create an AI-powered notes app with speech transcription and the new design system
```

This combination:
1. Uses SpeechAnalyzer for transcription (@WWDC25)
2. Applies Liquid Glass design throughout the app (@Liquid Glass)
3. Uses Foundation Models for summarization (@Foundation Models)

## Migration Guide

### Updating Existing Apps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Apply Liquid Glass">
    Transform your UI incrementally:
    ```
    @Liquid Glass Update the navigation buttons to use the glass modifiers
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate AI Features">
    Add intelligence thoughtfully:
    ```
    @Foundation Models Suggest AI features and improvements for my app to use the new Foundation Models framework
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
