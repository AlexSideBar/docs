## Commands in Alex Sidebar

There are new commands to help you implement the new design and work with the latest APIs. Use these command tags to access specific capabilities:

### @WWDC25 Mode

Access the latest Apple documentation related to WWDC 2025 by prefixing your requests with `@WWDC25`. For example, to get the context for the latest documentation for the SpeechAnalyzer API, you can use the following command:

```
@WWDC25 Implement the new SpeechAnalyzer API for real-time transcription
```

This mode gives Alex the context of:
- All iOS 26, macOS 26, and visionOS 26 APIs
- Liquid Glass design implementation
- New SwiftUI features like Rich Text Editor and 3D Charts
- Performance optimizations and best practices

**Example Uses:**
```
@WWDC25 Create a 3D chart in the given view with the new Charts API
@WWDC25 Implement the new WebKit APIs for in-app browsers
```

### @Foundation Models Command

Use Apple's language model directly in your apps. Here is an example of how to use the `@Foundation Models` command:

```
@FoundationModel Create a suggestion system using the new Foundation Models API for generating name recommendations
```

**Example Implementation:**
```swift
import FoundationModels

// Access Apple's on-device foundation model with just a few lines
let session = try await LanguageModelSession()

// Generate structured data from natural language
let prompt = "Create a daily journal entry from these notes: \(userNotes)"

let response = try await session.respond(
    to: prompt,
    generating: JournalEntry.self
)

// The model runs entirely on-device, protecting user privacy
let journalEntry = response.content
```

### @Liquid Glass Command

Update your UI with the new Liquid Glass design system. Here is an example of how to use the `@Liquid Glass` command:

```
@Liquid Glass Update the custom button to use the new Liquid Glass design
```

## Combining Commands

Use multiple commands together for better results. Here is an example of how to use the `@WWDC25`, `@Liquid Glass`, and `@Foundation Models` commands together:

```
@WWDC25 @Liquid Glass @Foundation Models 
Create an AI-powered notes app with speech transcription and the new design system
```

This combination:
1. Uses SpeechAnalyzer for transcription (@WWDC25)
2. Applies Liquid Glass design throughout the app (@Liquid Glass)
3. Uses Foundation Models for summarization (@Foundation Models)

## Quick Reference

| Feature | Command | Example Usage |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| SpeechAnalyzer | @WWDC25 | `@WWDC25 Add real-time transcription` |
| Liquid Glass UI | @Liquid Glass | `@Liquid Glass Apply glass effects to my cards` |
| On-device AI | @Foundation Models | `@Foundation Models Generate text summaries locally` |
| 3D Charts | @WWDC25 | `@WWDC25 Create 3D charts in the given view with the new Charts API` |
| Rich Text | @WWDC25 | `@WWDC25 Add rich text editing to my app` |
