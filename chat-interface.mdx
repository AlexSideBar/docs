## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Code">
    In Xcode's editor window, highlight the code you want to discuss or improve.
    <Note>
      Providing relevant code context helps the AI better understand your
      question and provide more accurate responses.
    </Note>
  </Step>

<Step title="Start Chat">
  There are three main ways to start a chat: - Select code and press **Command +
  L** - Click the chat icon in the sidebar - Use **Command + Enter** for a new
  chat with full codebase context
