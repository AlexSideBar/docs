## Overview

Alex Sidebar is designed with privacy and security in mind. We maintain strict data handling practices to protect your code and personal information.

## Core Principles

- No code storage or collection
- Opt-out of all third-party training data
- Minimal analytics collection (feature usage and diagnostics only)
- Local storage prioritization

## Infrastructure

### API Processing

All LLM interactions are processed through our secure infrastructure:

1. API endpoint: https://api.alexcodes.app
2. Server location: United States (Render hosting)
3. Processing workflow:
   - Context collection from user selection
   - Prompt construction with provided context
   - Secure routing to model providers
   - Response delivery without data persistence

### Future Data Practices

We maintain a strict opt-out-by-default policy for all users. Any future data collection initiatives will:
- Require explicit user consent
- Be clearly communicated
- Include granular opt-in controls
- Maintain existing user preferences

## Data Storage

### Code Embeddings

Alex Sidebar implements local embedding storage for search functionality:

1. **Generation Process**
   - Automatic embedding of Xcode project code
   - Processing through VoyageAI's embedding service
   - Explicit opt-out from provider data collection

2. **Storage Location**
   - Local SQLite database
   - Path: Application Support/com.DanielEdrisian.AlexSideBar
   - No cloud storage or sync

### Chat History

Chat data management follows local-first principles:
- Storage in Application Support directory
- No server-side persistence
- User-controlled retention

## AI Provider Integration

### Chat Models

Current providers:
- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Perplexity

All integrations configured with:
- Training data opt-out enabled
- No persistent storage
- Request-only data transmission

### Code Application Models

Implementation providers:
- Groq
- Cerebras
- Fireworks AI
- Google (Gemini)

Security measures:
- Training opt-out enforced
- Temporary request processing
- No provider-side data retention

## Monitoring Systems

### Analytics Implementation

Posthog integration limited to:
- Feature activation events
- Command usage frequency
- No content or context collection
- Anonymous usage patterns

### Error Tracking System

Sentry implementation captures:
- Application crash reports
- Error stack traces
- Performance metrics
  - Frame rate analysis
  - UI responsiveness
- Basic system information
  - OS version
  - Device identifiers
  - IP addressing

## Authentication System

Firebase implementation handles:
- User authentication
- O1-Preview credit management
- Basic account state
