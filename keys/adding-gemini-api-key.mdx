To use Gemini's models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.0 Flash) in Xcode with Alex Sidebar without paying a subscription for Alex, you'll need a Google AI Studio API key.

Here's how to get one:

1. Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://aistudio.google.com)

2. Create an account or sign in if you already have one

3. Go to the (API Keys page)(https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

4. Click "Create API Key" and select a project to enable it for

5. Copy the API key - make sure to save it somewhere secure

6. In Alex Sidebar:
   - Open Settings (⚙️)
   - Select "Models" at the bottom of the page
   - Paste your AI Studio API key in the Gemini text field

<Note>
  Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. If you suspect your key has been compromised, you should immediately rotate it in the Google Cloud Console.
</Note>

## Usage & Billing

- Google Cloud bills based on the number of tokens used
- You can monitor your usage in the Google Cloud Console
