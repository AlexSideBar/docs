To use xAI's models (such as Grok-3 and Grok-3-mini) in Xcode with Alex Sidebar without paying a subscription for Alex, you'll need an xAI API key.

Here's how to get one:

1. Visit [xAI's Platform](https://console.x.ai)

2. Create an account or sign in if you already have one

3. Once logged in, navigate to the API Keys section on the left sidebar

4. Click "Create API Key"

5. Give your key a name (e.g., "Alex Sidebar") and hit Save

6. Copy the API key - make sure to save it somewhere secure as you won't be able to see it again

7. In Alex Sidebar:
   - Open Settings (⚙️)
   - Select "Models" at the bottom of the page
   - Paste your xAI API key in the xAI text field

<Note>
  Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. If you suspect your key has been compromised, you should immediately rotate it in the xAI Platform.
</Note>

## Usage & Billing

- xAI bills based on the number of tokens used
- You can monitor your usage in the xAI Platform
- Set up billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges
- New accounts typically come with some free credits to get started

For more information about xAI's pricing and usage, visit [xAI's pricing page](https://x.ai/api#pricing).

<Note>
  Enabling xAI does not give you access to all of Alex's features. To enable codebase indexing, follow the [VoyageAI API Key Instructions](/get-started/adding-voyage-ai-api-key), and to enable Thinking mode, follow the [FireworksAI API Key Instructions](/get-started/adding-fireworks-ai-api-key).
</Note>

<Note>
  For Claude models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3.7 Sonnet, follow the [Anthropic API Key Instructions](/get-started/adding-claude-anthropic-ai-api-key).
