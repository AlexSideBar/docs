To use Fireworks AI's models (Thinking mode, DeepSeek R1, and DeepSeek V3 New) in Xcode with Alex Sidebar without paying a subscription for Alex, you'll need a Fireworks AI API key.

Here's how to get one:

1. Visit [Fireworks AI's Console](https://fireworks.ai)

2. Create an account or sign in if you already have one

3. Once logged in, navigate to the [API Keys page](https://fireworks.ai/account/api-keys) in your account settings

4. Click "Create API Key"

5. Give your key a name (e.g., "Alex Sidebar") and create it

6. Copy the API key - make sure to save it somewhere secure as you won't be able to see it again

7. In Alex Sidebar:
   - Open Settings (⚙️)
   - Select "Models" at the bottom of the page
   - Paste your Fireworks AI API key in the Fireworks AI text field

<Note>
  Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. If you suspect your key has been compromised, you should immediately rotate it in the Fireworks AI Console.
</Note>

## Usage & Billing

- Fireworks AI bills based on the number of tokens used
- You can monitor your usage in the Fireworks AI Console
- Set up billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges
- New accounts typically come with some free credits to get started

  Enabling Fireworks AI does not give you access to all of Alex's features. To enable codebase indexing, follow the [VoyageAI API Key Instructions](/get-started/adding-voyage-ai-api-key), and to enable Claude models, follow the [Anthropic API Key Instructions](/get-started/adding-claude-anthropic-ai-api-key).
</Note>

<Note>
  For other models like GPT 4o and the o-series (o1, o3, o3-mini), follow the [OpenAI API Key Instructions](/get-started/adding-openai-api-key).
