To use Claude's models (such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3.7 Sonnet) in Xcode with Alex Sidebar without paying a subscription for Alex, you'll need an Anthropic API key.

Here's how to get one:

1. Visit [Anthropic's Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)

2. Create an account or sign in if you already have one

3. Once logged in, navigate to the API Keys section in your account settings

4. Click "Create New API Key"

5. Give your key a name (e.g., "Alex Sidebar") and create it

6. Copy the API key - make sure to save it somewhere secure as you won't be able to see it again

7. In Alex Sidebar:
   - Open Settings (⚙️)
   - Select "Models" at the bottom of the page
   - Paste your Anthropic API key in the Anthropic text field

<Note>
  Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. If you suspect your key has been compromised, you should immediately rotate it in the Anthropic Console.
</Note>

## Usage & Billing

- Anthropic bills based on the number of tokens used
- You can monitor your usage in the Anthropic Console
- Set up billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges
- New accounts typically come with some free credits to get started

<Note>
  Enabling Anthropic does not give you access to all of Alex's features. For other models like Claude Sonnet or GPT 4o, follow the [Anthropic API Key Instructions](/get-started/adding-claude-anthropic-ai-api-key) and [OpenAI API Key Instructions](/get-started/adding-openai-ai-api-key) respectively. To enable enable Thinking mode, follow the [FireworksAI API Key Instructions](/get-started/adding-claude-anthropic-ai-api-key).
