To use codebase indexing in Xcode, we use Voyage AI's code embedding models.

To use Voyage AI in Alex Sidebar without paying a subscription for Alex, you'll need a Voyage AI API key.

Here's how to get one:

1. Visit [Voyage AI's Console](https://voyageai.com/)

2. Create an account or sign in if you already have one

3. Once logged in, navigate to the [API Keys page](https://dashboard.voyageai.com/api-keys)

4. Click "Create New Secret Key"

5. Give your key a name (e.g., "Alex Sidebar") and create it

6. Copy the API key - make sure to save it somewhere secure as you won't be able to see it again

7. In Alex Sidebar:
   - Open Settings (⚙️)
   - Select "Models" at the bottom of the page
   - Paste your Voyage AI API key in the Voyage AI text field

<Note>
  Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. If you suspect your key has been compromised, you should immediately rotate it in the Voyage AI Console.
</Note>

## Usage & Billing

- Voyage AI bills based on the number of tokens used
- You can monitor your usage in the Voyage AI Console
- Set up billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges
- New accounts typically come with some free credits to get started

For more information about Voyage AI's pricing and usage, visit [Voyage AI's pricing page](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/pricing).

<Note>
  Enabling Voyage AI does not give you access to all of Alex's features. For other models like Claude Sonnet or GPT 4o, follow the [Anthropic API Key Instructions](/get-started/adding-claude-anthropic-ai-api-key) and [OpenAI API Key Instructions](/get-started/adding-openai-api-key) respectively. To enable Thinking mode, follow the [FireworksAI API Key Instructions](/get-started/adding-fireworks-ai-api-key).
