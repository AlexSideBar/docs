2. Create an account or sign in if you already have one

3. Click "Create API Key"

4. Give your key a name (e.g., "Alex Sidebar") and optionally set a credit spend limit

5. Copy the API key - make sure to save it somewhere secure as you won't be able to see it again

6. 7. In Alex Sidebar:
   - Open Settings (⚙️)
   - Select "Models and API Keys" under the "Tools & Features" section
   - Paste your OpenRouter API key in the OpenRouter key text field under the OpenRouter Models

  Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. If you suspect your key has been compromised, you should immediately rotate it in your OpenRouter settings.
