To use OpenAI's models (such as GPT-4o and the o-series models) in Xcode with Alex Sidebar without paying a subscription for Alex, you'll need an OpenAI API key.

Here's how to get one:

1. Visit [OpenAI's Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)

2. Create an account or sign in if you already have one

3. Once logged in, navigate to the API Keys section in your account settings

4. Click "Create New API Key"

5. Give your key a name (e.g., "Alex Sidebar"), select a project (or default project) and create it

6. Copy the API key - make sure to save it somewhere secure as you won't be able to see it again

7. In Alex Sidebar:
   - Open Settings (⚙️)
   - Select "Models" at the bottom of the page
   - Paste your OpenAI API key in the OpenAI text field

<Note>
  Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. If you suspect your key has been compromised, you should immediately rotate it in the OpenAI Platform.
</Note>

## Usage & Billing

- OpenAI bills based on the number of tokens used
- You can monitor your usage in the OpenAI Platform
- Set up billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges
- New accounts typically come with some free credits to get started
