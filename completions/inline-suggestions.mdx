  />
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trigger Suggestions">
    Position your cursor where you want to generate code (or select existing code) in **Xcode** and press **Command + K**
    K**
    <Note>
      The AI analyzes your current file context to provide relevant suggestions
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Model">
    Choose from available AI models for completion:
    - Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Advanced model for complex completions
    - GPT-4: Balanced performance and accuracy
    - Gemini Flash 2.0: Fast, lightweight completions

    <Note>
      You can add additional models through the Model Settings, including:
      - Local models via Ollama integration
      - Custom API-compatible models
      - Other OpenAI-compatible endpoints
      
      See the [Model Configuration](/configuration/model-configuration) section for detailed setup instructions.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  

  <Step title="Review Options">
    - Press Enter to accept the current suggestion
    - Press Esc to dismiss suggestions
    - Click retry button to generate new suggestions

## Error and Warning Resolution

When Xcode displays errors or warnings, Alex Sidebar can help resolve them quickly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Quick Fix">
    Click the error/warning indicator in Xcode's gutter
  </Step>

<Step title="Review Solution">
  Alex Sidebar automatically: - Captures the error context - Analyzes the error
  message - Suggests relevant fixes
</Step>

  <Step title="Apply Fix">
    Review the suggested solution and click "Apply" to implement the fix
    <Note>
      Always review suggested changes before applying them to ensure they align

    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Model Selection" icon="robot">
    - Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet for complex logic
    - Choose GPT-4 for balanced performance
    - Select Gemini Flash 2.0 for quick completions
  </Card>

  <Card title="Completion Tips" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    - Use Command + K for larger completions
    - Try different models if results aren't ideal
    - Use retry option for alternative suggestions
    - Tab complete for quick suggestions

## SwiftUI Code Examples

Here are some practical examples of how Alex Sidebar's inline suggestions work with SwiftUI code:

    Start typing a basic SwiftUI view and let inline suggestions help:
    ```swift
    struct ContentView: View {
      var body: some View {
        // Type "VStack", wait for a bit and then press TAB
        VStack(spacing: 16) {
          Text("Hello, World!")
            .font(.title)
            .foregroundColor(.blue)

          Button("Tap me") {
            // Suggestions will offer action implementations
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

<AccordionGroup>
  
  <Accordion title="Property Wrappers">
    Get intelligent suggestions for SwiftUI property wrappers:
    ```swift
    struct TodoView: View {
      // Type "@St" and use Tab completion
      @State private var taskTitle = ""
      // Type "@Ob" for Observable properties
      @ObservedObject var viewModel: TodoViewModel
      
      var body: some View {
        Form {
          TextField("Task Title", text: $taskTitle)
          // Suggestions will offer common modifiers
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Custom Modifiers">
    Get suggestions for custom view modifiers:
    ```swift
    struct CardModifier: ViewModifier {
      // Type "func" and let suggestions complete the method
      func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
          .padding()
          .background(Color.white)
          .cornerRadius(10)
          .shadow(radius: 5)
      }
    }

    // Usage example with inline suggestions
    Text("Card Content")
      .modifier(CardModifier())
    ```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  The examples above demonstrate common SwiftUI patterns where inline
  suggestions are particularly helpful. As you type these patterns, Alex Sidebar
  will suggest: - Property wrapper completions - View modifier chains - Common
  SwiftUI view structures - Closure completions
</Note>

<Warning>
  While AI suggestions are powerful, always review generated code to ensure it
  meets your requirements and follows your project's conventions.
