Tab completions in Alex Sidebar go beyond simple autocomplete. They understand your code's context and can suggest entire blocks, complete functions, and even refactor existing code across multiple lines.

## How Tab Works

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsInline
  alt="Multiline tab completions in action"
  title="Tab through complex code changes"
  src="/videos/multiline-tab-demo.mp4"
/>

As you type, Alex Sidebar analyzes your code and suggests completions that appear as ghost text. Press **Tab** to accept the suggestion and watch as it intelligently fills in multiple lines at once.

## Using Tab Completions

### Basic Usage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start typing">
    Write your code normally. Alex Sidebar watches for opportunities to help.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="See suggestions">
    Ghost text appears showing what Alex suggests. This could be:
    - Completing the current line
    - Adding multiple lines to finish a function
    - Refactoring existing code above or below
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Accept or reject">
    - **Tab**: Accept the entire suggestion
    - **Esc**: Dismiss the suggestion
    - **Command + →**: Accept word by word
    - Keep typing to ignore and get new suggestions
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Advanced Features

#### Pattern Recognition

When you make a change in one place, Tab recognizes the pattern and suggests similar changes elsewhere. For example:

- Change one variable name, Tab suggests updating all references
- Update one SwiftUI modifier, Tab suggests the same change for similar views
- Fix one error, Tab knows how to fix similar errors throughout your file

#### Contextual Understanding

Tab completions consider:
- Your recent edits and what you're working on
- The structure of your current function or class
- Import statements and available APIs
- Your coding style and naming conventions
- Xcode's build errors and warnings

## Multiline Magic

Unlike basic autocomplete, Tab can suggest complex, multi-line changes:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Complete implementations">
    Start typing a function signature and Tab completes the entire implementation based on context
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Protocol conformance">
    Add a protocol to your class and Tab suggests all required method implementations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Error fixes">
    Tab sees compiler errors and suggests multi-line fixes that resolve the issue
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Boilerplate code">
    Generate common patterns like table view data sources, SwiftUI views, or test cases
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Tab

Toggle Tab completions in Settings → Features & Keybindings → Enable Autocomplete under the "Editor Features" section.

### Completion Behavior

Configure when Tab suggestions appear:
- **Always**: Show suggestions continuously as you type
- **Manual**: Only show when you press Tab
- **Smart**: Show based on context (recommended)

### Performance Settings

For larger projects, you can adjust:
- Context window size
- Suggestion delay
- File analysis depth

<Note>
Tab completions work best when codebase indexing is enabled. This helps Alex understand your project structure and provide more accurate suggestions.
</Note>

## Tips for Better Completions

1. **Write descriptive comments** - Tab uses comments to understand your intent
2. **Use consistent naming** - Helps Tab learn your patterns
3. **Keep files organized** - Better project structure means better suggestions
4. **Let Tab see errors** - Build your project so Tab can see and fix compiler errors

## Common Use Cases

### SwiftUI Development
Tab excels at SwiftUI's declarative syntax, suggesting entire view hierarchies and modifier chains.

### Async/Await
Writing async code? Tab suggests proper error handling and await patterns.

### Testing
Start a test function and Tab suggests the arrange-act-assert structure with relevant test data.

### Refactoring
Select code and Tab suggests cleaner implementations or modern Swift patterns.

## Troubleshooting

### Suggestions not appearing?
- Check that Tab completions are enabled in settings
- Ensure codebase indexing has completed
- Try manually triggering with Tab key

### Poor quality suggestions?
- Let indexing complete for your project
- Make sure you're using a model with good code understanding
- Consider switching to a more powerful model for complex code

### Tab interfering with regular tabs?
- You can still insert regular tabs by pressing Shift + Tab
- Or temporarily disable Tab completions when not needed

<Warning>
Tab completions use your selected AI model and consume credits based on the model's pricing. Monitor your usage if you're on a limited plan.
</Warning>

## The Future of Coding

Multiline Tab completions represent a shift in how we write code. Instead of typing every character, you guide the AI with your intent and let it handle the implementation details. It's like having a senior developer looking over your shoulder, ready to finish your thoughts.

Ready to code faster? Start typing and let Tab do the heavy lifting.
