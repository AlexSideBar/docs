Tab completions in Alex Sidebar go beyond simple autocomplete. They understand your code's context and can suggest entire blocks and complete functions based on what you're writing.

<Note>
To enable Multiline suggestions, which is currently an alpha feature, go to:

1. Settings
2. Features & Keybindings
3. Enable Multiline Suggestions

Because multline suggestions requires screen access, you will need to enable screen recording access to AlexSideBar in your system preferences.

Multiline tab (alpha) is available from version 3.3
</Note>

## How Tab Works

As you type, Alex Sidebar analyzes your code and suggests completions that appear as completion text. Press **Tab** to accept the suggestion and watch as it intelligently fills in multiple lines at once.

<Note>
To disable interferece with Xcode, please disable Apple's predictive code completion in Xcode → Settings → Text Editing → Editing → uncheck "Use code completion".

## Using Tab Completions

### Basic Usage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start typing">
    Write your code normally. Alex Sidebar watches for opportunities to help.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="See suggestions">
    Completion text appears showing what Alex suggests. This could be:
    - Completing the current line
    - Adding multiple lines to finish a function
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Accept or reject">
    - **Tab**: Accept the entire suggestion
    - **Esc**: Dismiss the suggestion
    - Keep typing to ignore and get new suggestions
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Advanced Features

#### Learning from Context

Tab uses your recent edits and previous tab acceptances to provide more relevant suggestions.

#### Contextual Understanding

Tab completions consider:
- Your recent edits and what you're working on
- The structure of your current function or class
- Import statements and available APIs
- Your coding style and naming conventions
- Xcode's build errors and warnings

<Note>
Tab remembers your previous accepts across different files. When you accept a suggestion in one file, it learns from that pattern and applies similar suggestions in other files you work on.
</Note>


## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Tab

Toggle Tab completions in Settings → Features & Keybindings → Enable Autocomplete under the "Editor Features" section.

<Note>
Tab completions work best when codebase indexing is enabled. This helps Alex understand your project structure and provide more accurate suggestions.
</Note>

You can also quickly enable/disable it in the system menubar when Alex is focused (Autocomplete section).


## Troubleshooting

### Suggestions not appearing?
- Check that Tab completions are enabled in settings
- Try manually triggering with Tab key
