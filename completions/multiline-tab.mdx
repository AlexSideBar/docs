Tab completions in Alex Sidebar go beyond simple autocomplete. They understand your code's context and can suggest entire blocks and complete functions based on what you're writing.

## How Tab Works

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop

  alt="Multiline tab completions in action"
  title="Tab through complex code changes"

/>

As you type, Alex Sidebar analyzes your code and suggests completions that appear as completion text. Press **Tab** to accept the suggestion and watch as it intelligently fills in multiple lines at once.

<Note>
For optimal Tab completion performance, disable Apple's predictive code completion in Xcode → Settings → Text Editing → Editing → uncheck "Use code completion".

## Using Tab Completions

### Basic Usage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start typing">
    Write your code normally. Alex Sidebar watches for opportunities to help.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="See suggestions">
    Completion text appears showing what Alex suggests. This could be:
    - Completing the current line
    - Adding multiple lines to finish a function
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Accept or reject">
    - **Tab**: Accept the entire suggestion
    - **Esc**: Dismiss the suggestion
    - Keep typing to ignore and get new suggestions
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Advanced Features

#### Learning from Context

Tab uses your recent edits and previous tab acceptances to provide more relevant suggestions.

#### Contextual Understanding

Tab completions consider:
- Your recent edits and what you're working on
- The structure of your current function or class
- Import statements and available APIs
- Your coding style and naming conventions
- Xcode's build errors and warnings

<Note>
Tab remembers your previous accepts across different files. When you accept a suggestion in one file, it learns from that pattern and applies similar suggestions in other files you work on.
</Note>


## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Tab

Toggle Tab completions in Settings → Features & Keybindings → Enable Autocomplete under the "Editor Features" section.

<Note>
Tab completions work best when codebase indexing is enabled. This helps Alex understand your project structure and provide more accurate suggestions.
</Note>



## Troubleshooting

### Suggestions not appearing?
- Check that Tab completions are enabled in settings
- Try manually triggering with Tab key

### Poor quality suggestions?
- Make sure you're using a model with good code understanding
- Consider switching to a more powerful model for complex code
